### **UML Use Case Diagram:** This diagrams helps us identify the interactions between all the users. The user can do actions like request a ride, rate one, track the ride, and process the payment after. The driver can track the ride as well and they can accept a ride and get an optimized route. The admin can monitor the system and manager users and any disputes they submit

### **UML Domain Model:** The domain model shows the classes and the relationships between them. In this diagram there is a one-to-many relationship between passenger and ride, driver and ride, and ride and rating which means one attribute can belong to multiple classes at a time. There is a one-to-one relationship between ride and payment because one ride can only have one payment attached to it

###  **UML Class Diagram:** The class diagram shows how multiple classes work together to make the system functional. In this case the passenger requests a ride, the driver accepts it, once the ride is done the ride can calculate the fare and then the user can make the payment and submit the rating.

###  ** UML Sequence Diagram:** The sequence diagram shows the exact step by step process of what happens when the user requests a ride. The information above the arrow in this diagram shows this information and where the arrow is pointing towards is the stage of the system.

### ** UML State Diagram:** The state diagram shows the state of the system and which level each step is at, and it also shows which actions led to that state.

### **UML Activity Diagram:** The activity diagram shows all the steps taken by the user in a chronological order.

### ** UML Component Diagram:** The component diagram shows all the major components needed for the system to function appropriately.

### ** Cloud Deployment Diagram:** The deployment diagram shows how the system is divided into smaller, individual services.
